[1:28:54] shogyoumujou: Chat is this black stake?
[1:28:55] CarGnome: @northernlion The best argument I can make for 2x watching is that some content creators don't make their content concise. Either they don't edit much out, or they speak slowly, or just throw in too much irrelevant information. Some even intentionally make the video longer. As a whole, YouTube essays are getting longer and longer. Essentially, I'm there for the information, but I don't want to waste 3 hours on just one video essay about the history of shoelaces.

[4:01:10] destinyvlad: "is that ham processed? If it's processed I don't want it" Ma'am, that is an eleven pound whole slab of deli ham. It has no bones, fat, or connective tissue. It is an amalgamation of the meat of several pigs, emulsified, liquefied, strained, and ultimately inexorably joined in an unholy meat obelisk. God had no hand in the creation of this abhorrence. The fact that this ham monolith exists proves that God is either impotent to alter His universe or ignorant to the horrors
