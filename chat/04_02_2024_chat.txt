Your wardrobe is likely a mix of thrifted finds and trendy pieces, trying to embody that effortlessly cool NYC pop vibe. You're the person who always knows the best underground shows to attend, but also secretly blasts Pitbull in your car on the way home. Your friends probably never know what to expect from you
