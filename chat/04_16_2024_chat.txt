[1:10:05] metatechno: perhaps the true essence of sisyphus lies not in the repetitive act of rolling the boulder, but in the moment when he pauses at the peak without the burden of the rock. in those fleeting moments of respite, sisyphus is free from the weight of his task, liberated from the endless cycle of toil and futility. thus, reaching the top of the mountain without the boulder could symbolize a moment of existential clarity and freedom. release the boulder. reach the top alone. embrace free will.

[1:23:06] Kerosene__Chugger: @Northernlion just a theory; perhaps the true essence of sisyphus lies not in the repetitive act of rolling the boulder, but in the moment when he pauses at the peak without the burden of the rock. in those fleeting moments of respite, sisyphus is free from the weight of his task, liberated from the endless cycle of toil and futility. thus, reaching the top of the mountain without the boulder could symbolize a moment of existential clarity and freedom. release the boulder. reach the top alone.

[2:06:18] wheeldragon: so when coca-cola used to be made from kola nut, it naturally had caffeine in it. So when it stopped being made from the kola nut, they artificially added caffeine to keep the flavor. In 1980, the FDA tried to outlaw caffeine in soft drinks, but the manufacturers protested and said it's used for its flavor. Turns out though, that's a lie. A lot of researchers have show that people can't tell a difference in taste between a soda with or without caffeine.

[2:08:16] wheeldragon: so when coca-cola used to be made from kola nut, it naturally had caffeine in it. So when it stopped being made from the kola nut, they artificially added caffeine to keep the flavor. In 1980, the FDA tried to outlaw caffeine in soft drinks, but the manufacturers protested and said it's used for its flavor. Turns out though, that's a lie. A lot of researchers have show that people can't tell a difference in taste between a soda with or without caffeine.
