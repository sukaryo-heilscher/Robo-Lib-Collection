[3:45:26] tardyisland: I am a meager YouTube user and a Twitch chat lurker, yet I am here to recommend ***. It is a fantastic new roguelike heavily based on Pokemon. It replaced Balatro during my game time and would help train your Pokedoku knowledge. It is well made, and it contains Pokemon from original Pokemon games. You would enjoy it, and your pride(viewers) would, too.
