[3:08:05] not_bradlington: can you beat his ass in a game of chess?
[3:08:06] whoadizzyy: there is a non-zero chance he suddenly dies and you win by default
[3:08:06] bornstray: i would cave his skull in after like 3 days

[3:10:13] friciousw33dgod: id use vibrating anal beads on the first day
[3:10:14] TheGarlicGun: poison him and then win by default
[3:10:14] tertiaryextent: if you beat him off isn't that beating him?
[3:10:15] NeoTenico: Do the Bill Murray trick and learn so much about him that I can unload everything I know at once, convince him I'm in a time loop, and then he lets me win
[3:10:15] TheOrangeBread: Can i use a chess computer before each game to plug in his moves?
[3:10:15] Tahoth: I would alternate turns, so that I copy his opening move next time, use it against him, and see how he plays it
[3:10:17] AMNDom: NL, what if you just had to learn to solve a Rubik's cube?
[3:10:17] Olegty: i would train my memory for like 4 years
[3:10:17] skad___: After you figured out the flowchart and escape, would you then go play him in real life?
[3:10:17] ishyma3l: The tech is to get Gary to teach you over time
[3:10:17] Piratenbrot: after enough time, if i remember every game, I could eventually find a way, through trial and error over years
[3:10:17] simonporse: i love balatro, buth there's a mario shaped hole in my heart
[3:10:18] jaydpwnz: Just ask him to throw the game
[3:10:18] AlbatrossofTime: first i would get garry addicted to video games

[3:10:21] Chilli5m: I would just discombobulate, 6 month recovery for Gary
[3:10:21] ley38: I after every loss I think I would resort to violence thinking he was my captor
[3:10:21] not_bradlington: point behin dhim and flip the board around
[3:10:22] 25th_jake: there's probably a way to get him playing against himself
[3:10:22] MzterE: I was asked this yesterday and tried to calculate how many variations of chess moves there are and memorizing all of them. My first answer was 100,000. Then I was posed that gary could make a mistake. I am probably 1300 elo. I went down to 3000 days

[3:10:26] zazzlebar: can you kick gary in the nuts in the hypothetical?
[3:10:27] TisIAllie: Talk to the man, learn how to play chess from him, do some exercise, read books. I mean, if I'm going to be stuck forever, I might as well do the things I love.
[3:10:27] viruszwerg125: EZ
[3:10:28] aschitt316: @Northernlion Alternate hypothetical - you get access to reading material, but you have to somehow figure out how to make it to wherever Gary Kasparov is living from your random-ass house in NA before the day finishes
