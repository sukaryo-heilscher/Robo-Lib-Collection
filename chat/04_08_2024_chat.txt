[2:13:56] hotboytoke: hey NL thoughts on the Jags moves in Free Agency? I feel like losing Ridley is a blessing in disguise looking at how much the Titans overpaid him, Gabe Davis isn't a terrible replacement but i think we go WR in the 2nd round of the draft to address the room. we lost some defensive guys too in the backfield but I think getting Savage and Darby aren't the worst replacements. Getting a new Center and Arik Armstead were the best moves imo. I really hope we go CB in the 1st round
