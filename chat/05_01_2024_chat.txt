[3:26:26] ironholmes: @kugel7c Basically, studies show that if kids grow up together but aren't related, they're less likely to find each other attractive when they're adults. They often don't marry each other, and if they do, they might not have many kids, and are more likely to split up or not stay faithful. This is a way to gauge how much they actually desire each other.
